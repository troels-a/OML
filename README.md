# Open Music License (OML)
OML is a computer readable license format for open music releases to declare terms of usage. Open music releases function much like open source code in the sense that they are freely available yet still subject to licenses. Open music releases should include an `oml` namespace in their accompanying metadata if they want to declare programmatically how the media is allowed to be used and presented in various context.

Music NFT platforms like [Catalog](https://catalog.works) could allow artists to define context and actor based usage on mint. The choices would be intergrated into the NFT metadata and could then be read by any person, protocol or platform wishing to utilize the media. Apps and services can adjust their code and UI to reflect the license terms set by the original artist. This makes the open music release a powerful single source of truth that both protect artsist, platforms and users.
